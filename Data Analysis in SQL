1) How many reward offers were completed? Which offers had the highest completion rate?
SELECT
	o.offer_type,
	COUNT(*) AS Total_Transactions,
	(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER ()) AS PRC
FROM CLEAN_CAFE C
LEFT JOIN offers O ON c.value=o.offer_id
WHERE c.event='offer completed'
GROUP BY o.offer_type

2) How are customer demographics distributed? Are there any demographic patterns in offer completion?

	WHEN AGE BETWEEN 36 AND 50 THEN '36-50'
	WHEN AGE BETWEEN 51 AND 65 THEN '51-65'
	ELSE '65+'
END AS Age_Group,
	COUNT(*) AS Customer_Count,
	(COUNT(*)*100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER ()) AS Completion_Rate
